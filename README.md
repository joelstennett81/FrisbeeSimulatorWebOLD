This is an ultimate frisbee simulation application. It is developed using Django Rest Framework and HTMl/Javascript
Users can create a four team, 8 team and 16 team tournament and simulate it.
You can also create individual games and simulate them.
Users can create individual players, teams as well, and assign ratings to them.
The system takes these ratings, and simulates games throw by throw, point by point, and accumulates them all and displays what happens and keeps track of stats.
The system uses a probability algorithm, combined with skill ratings to simulate what will happen. 
The idea is you can predict what will happen in an upcoming tournament, and look at stats.
